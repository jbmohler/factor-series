Let $\Omega(x)=\sum e_i$ if $x=\prod p_i^{e_i}$ is the prime factorization of $x$.

Let $\Psi_t$ be the set of integers such that if $x\in \Psi_t$ then
$\Omega(x+m)=t$ for $1\leq m<2^t$.  It is easy to see that elements of $\Psi_t$
are one less than a maximal sequence of numbers with fixed $\Omega$.

We will show that $2\Psi_2\subseteq\Psi_3$ and generally that
$2\Psi_t\subseteq\Psi_{t+1}$.  We'll call this the inclusion property.

With these definitions observe that $Psi_1$ is the set of even integers that
precede prime numbers union the set ${1}$.  With that exception in mind, the
rest of this article excludes any statements of $\Psi_1$.

\section{Optimized Primality Sieve}

For $t>1$, there can be no longer sequence of $x\in \mathbb{Z}$ with
$\Omega(x)=t$ than $2^t-1$ elements.
Observe that $\Omega(m\cdot 2^t)>t$ as long as $m>1$.



% low factor sieve based on $2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7$.
% special algorithm for $\Psi_2$
% generate test cases \Psi_3 from each element of $\Psi_2$.



\section{Distribution of $\Gamma_n(t)$}

% distribution of $\Gamma_n$ and $\Gamma_n^{odd}$.
% fixed tail of $\Gamma_n$

Let $\Gamma_n(t)=#\{x|\Omega(x)=t\textrm{ and }2^n\leq x<2^{n+1}\}$
and $\Gamma^{odd}_n(t)=#\{x|\Omega(x)=t\textrm{ and }x odd\textrm{ and }2^n\leq x<2^{n+1}\}$.  Then 
\[
	\Gamma_n(t)=\Gamma_{n-1}(t-1)+\Gamma_n^{odd}(t)\textrm{.}
	\]

\section{Observed Cardinalities of Bounded $Psi_t$}

% expected occurrences if $\Omega(x)$ is independent for distinct $x$
% expected cardinalities of $\Psi_t$ based on $\Psi_{t-1}$.
% conjectural smallest elemnt of $\Psi_5$.
